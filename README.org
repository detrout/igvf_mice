* Introduction

This project is to build a django database for tracking our part
of the IGVF mouse experiment.

mousedemo is the example site
igvf_mice is the app designed to track the wet bench phase of the data collection.

Somehow there will be additional components for tracking
demultiplexing and analysis.
