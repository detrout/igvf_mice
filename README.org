* Introduction

This project is to build a django database for tracking our part
of the IGVF mouse experiment.

mousedemo is the example site
igvf_mice is the app designed to track the wet bench phase of the data collection.

Somehow there will be additional components for tracking
demultiplexing and analysis.

* IGVF_Split-seq spreadsheet cleaning <2023-05-04 Thu>

- [X] Comment in Estrus field on Mice - 8 samples
- [X] Several Estrus fields were misspelled
- [ ] extra row on Bridge Samples into experiment

Why is there a space in the empty cells on row 1 in samples into
experiment?

- [X] On the bridge samples is it just left cortex, and not the
cortex/hipppcampus from the 8 cube?
  Liz: The bridge samples are just left cortex

- [ ] Header columns on Bridge samples into experiment were different
from Samples into experiment. There were a bunch of merged cells
with a 2 layer index.

- [X] Me: I'm also having trouble finding 093_CASTJ_10M_08 which is listed
  on Plate setup but not in Samples into experiment Lines 745 to 746.
  Go from 091_CASTJ_10M_08 to 094_CASTJ_10M_08 on Samples into
  experiment

  Liz: Why Oh good catch. Yeah 093 failed so we went with 095. Plate
    setup has typo Same thing with IGVF_010 and 011, had to do 5th rep
    So plate setups will be off since I didnâ€™t go through and fix the
    ones that got swapped out, just copy-pasted previous setups

- [ ] Can we call the bridge sample plate IGVF_B01 to be more
  consistent with others?


* dealing with the _25 and _26 samples from F1 samples into experiments

It's around IGVF_FIX_019

_25 is testis left _27 & epydidmus left _29
_26 is ovary _10 & oviduct _11

the pooled from can be calculated with, though with changing the row number
=CONCAT(LEFT(AJ403, LEN(AJ403)-3), "_10,",LEFT(AJ403, LEN(AJ403)-3),"_11")

",".join([AJ403[:-3]+x for x in ["_010", "_011"]])

* kidney 09

from kidney left _31 and kidney right _32
